Some utility functions and scripts to:  

- run sequential/concurrent performance tests on a web service (e.g. created with R & OpenCPU Server). Based around the [loadtest](https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest) js library by [alexfernandez](https://github.com/alexfernandez).
- clean up & analyse the json outputs of above as well as the output of running `top` in batch mode, on the server where the web service is also running.
- visualise the results with R or D3 for some simple interactive look.  

## TODO

- add more documentation.
- some simple things can be parametrised in order to make it easier perhaps for others to use.


Please feel free to comment, give me feedback or contact me about anything regarding these scripts. In it's current state, this repo would be mostly un-decipherable but I'm planning to add more docs and examples whenever i have some more time on my hands.
